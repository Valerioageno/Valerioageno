# Ciao ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an frontent engineer by day and a random things student by night.

My favourite tecnologies are Typescript & Rust and I am also interested on WebAssembly.

Iâ€™m also passionate about 3D modelling andÂ [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)

## Working on ðŸš§

I'm currently working onÂ [ssr_rs](https://github.com/Valerioageno/ssr-rs)Â which is a rust crate that allows JS code execution within rust programs and on [tuono](https://github.com/Valerioageno/tuono) that is a fullstack react framework with the backend written in rust for crazy multi-thread performance! (yeah it uses `ssr_rs`)
