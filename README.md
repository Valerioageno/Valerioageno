# Ciao 👋

I’m an Italian software engineer passionate about the web. 

I like trying to mix things together and see what happens - now is the time for [tuono](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono)⚡️full stack web framework.

I like to write code with Typescript, Rust and WebAssembly.

Offline I enjoy surfing 🏄‍♂️ 🌊
